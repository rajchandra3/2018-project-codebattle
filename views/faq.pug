                        | CodeBattle let's you compete with other people in solving coding related problems. The game is about solving a task. The task should be solved by writing code in an IDE that is on the website. When the task is resolved, the solution is submitted and the time it took is compared against the opponent's time. The shortest time wins the competition.

                        ul 
                            li Write a function that sorts a list
                            li Write a function that finds the n:th fibonacci number
                            li Write a function that prints a specific pattern
                            li Write a function that converts English to Morse code
                            li Write a function that converts a list to a binary search tree
                        | When you start a game you get clear instructions on what the task is, how the main function should be named and what the return format should look like.
